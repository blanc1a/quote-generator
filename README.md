# Quote Generator

## Description

This project is a Quote Generator built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It includes functionality to fetch quotes from a public API as well as from a local Mock API. The project is an assignment from the "Zero to Mastery" course, and the styling has been customized to suit personal preferences.
